p003_sentences_08_slow_2.wav|Now, look at that third name.
p072_sentences_12_highpitch_0.wav|His room was on the first floor. I have had a pattern in my hand. The knocking still continued

p008_freeform_speech_03_19.wav|Not being able to see the sky.

p034_emo_relief_sentences_1.wav|That was so stressful.
p085_sentences_24_regular_0.wav|You can well enjoy the evening now.
p049_freeform_speech_01_69.wav|And I came, and I was all excited.

p077_freeform_speech_04_8.wav|at a recording studio in West Mifflin,
p027_freeform_speech_02_24.wav|because I think I'd get seasick and probably throw up the whole time.

p074_emo_fear_sentences_0.wav|Did you hear that sound?

p049_sentences_01_regular_0.wav|I will not stay here.

p102_freeform_speech_01_34.wav|My ambition is to write movies as well.
p091_freeform_speech_02_42.wav|That kind of depends on kind of the job first.
p093_freeform_speech_02_23.wav|That's a great place to see a show.
p081_emo_realization_sentences_0.wav|Wow, I never knew that the body was made up of 75% water.
p048_sentences_09_fast_0.wav|and it seemed to her that God heard her prayer.
p035_freeform_speech_03_43.wav|A lot of language processing is also in the frontal lobe,
p051_freeform_speech_05_1.wav|when I was growing up we didn't have a lot of money so we didn't go on extravagant vacations
p076_freeform_speech_05_41.wav|Uh, and, you know, they go on and they make, I would say, one good Thor movie.

p074_freeform_speech_02_23.wav|different types of artwork and that's giving me like good sense of branding so

p048_freeform_speech_01_42.wav|They have concerts where there's people from the symphony come in
p032_freeform_speech_06_8.wav|It just seems that every, it just seems that ever since, you know, COVID came around, that things just started going downhill, and it's scary.
p077_emo_desire_sentences_1.wav|I want that car so badly.
p001_emo_contentment_freeform_1.wav|letting thoughts flow and not worrying about anything and just, you know,
p102_sentences_01_whisper_2.wav|Stay, stay, I will go myself.
p091_freeform_speech_02_16.wav|But I'm not really a person to go into the ocean, though,
p076_freeform_speech_01_6.wav|Um, and then, yeah, this leads you to the end, which I want to back things up and just say, like, the whole Luke Skywalker thing is so stupid.
p020_freeform_speech_04_4.wav|a while how to use the brush how to make corners how to you know I didn't want to
p017_sentences_22_regular_1.wav|The snowstorm was still raging.
p038_emo_realization_freeform_3.wav|One quarter of your bones are in your feet?
p026_freeform_speech_04_25.wav|And my favorite flower is tulips.
p026_freeform_speech_03_23.wav|because the whole time we were on the plane,
p050_freeform_speech_02_0.wav|let's see, so be in the summertime and early fall, I have a friend who's trying to sell a house
p002_freeform_speech_02_9.wav|of look at them like what the heck you listen to I couldn't name an artist if I

p071_emo_embarassment_freeform_4.wav|This is just, I can't go back there again and do it all over again every day.
p032_emo_sadness_freeform_2.wav|I already have three or I would take them home right now.
p077_sentences_20_regular_2.wav|Besides, what on earth could happen to you?
p090_freeform_speech_01_40.wav|So I thought you might be interested in that.
p016_sentences_21_regular_1.wav|You are fond of fighting.
p088_emo_fear_sentences_2.wav|What do you think is going to happen if we don't run?

p104_emo_sadness_freeform_1.wav|I want to get out and see the world. I just want to play like a regular puppy.
p025_emo_pain_sentences_0.wav|This headache is the worst one I've ever had.
p049_emo_confusion_freeform_8.wav|What's...
p071_emo_guilt_freeform_0.wav|I'm sorry for tearing up the fine china in the cabinet. I didn't really mean to. I was just having a fun time, but I can see that I messed up, did a bad job.
p032_freeform_speech_03_81.wav|And, you know, of course,
p101_emo_pride_sentences_0.wav|That was all me. I'm the one who founded the project, created the company, and made it succeed.
p023_freeform_speech_04_39.wav|Um...
p012_sentences_04_whisper_0.wav|I only heard it last night.
p088_freeform_speech_05_33.wav|I know there's some bits that I find pretty funny from SNL.
p004_emo_sadness_freeform_4.wav|Poor little guy.
p069_emo_realization_sentences_2.wav|Apparently dolphins sleep with one eye open.
p022_freeform_speech_03_7.wav|And I do not want to be that as the Pittsburgh Steelers.
p025_freeform_speech_06_20.wav|I haven't taken him outside.
p069_sentences_07_slow_4.wav|He seemed almost afraid of something.
p105_freeform_speech_02_17.wav|Okay.
p082_sentences_21_regular_1.wav|You are fond of fighting.
p077_sentences_13_lowpitch_0.wav|Just read it out to me.
p012_emo_relief_freeform_0.wav|I am so happy I got out of that traffic ticket I do not have the money for that right now
p046_freeform_speech_05_25.wav|But, um, my grandma will also make some either like lobster pasta or lobster ravioli and things
p058_freeform_speech_02_10.wav|also goes by so much faster in the morning for some reason. When I used to work nights, it was
p016_sentences_07_slow_1.wav|Clear up the room, the sick man said with effort.
p001_sentences_02_loud_0.wav|it might happen he added with an involuntary smile it is salt sir was again his laconic reply and you must have some water my dear fellow what is that flying about who wants a dead surat for the gold cup
p024_sentences_13_lowpitch_3.wav|The gate was again hidden by smoke.
p061_freeform_speech_06_9.wav|He always had like stubble on his face. I mean, these women, come on. I mean, in 15 seconds,
p040_emo_adoration_freeform_1.wav|I love you from your emotions to your personality
p069_sentences_02_slow_3.wav|What is that flying about?
p071_emo_fear_freeform_2.wav|I don't even know if I should peek out the window.
p063_freeform_speech_01_85.wav|On a baked mac and cheese.
p048_freeform_speech_01_20.wav|Then I can go over and work one day in one area,
p001_sentences_16_regular_4.wav|I have done my duty.
p050_freeform_speech_03_10.wav|And we did that for many years, and this year, I decided I was going to do the same thing, even
p001_freeform_speech_06_33.wav|Yeah.
p096_freeform_speech_05_72.wav|So I'm like, I think I'm almost done.
p076_sentences_18_regular_1.wav|She remembered her oath.
p054_sentences_06_loud_1.wav|You see what he writes?
p054_freeform_speech_02_22.wav|Unfortunately, I do a lot of work outside.
p031_emo_contentment_sentences_0.wav|I really enjoyed dinner tonight. It was quite nice.
p046_freeform_speech_04_9.wav|and it's something I go back to a lot.
p084_sentences_11_highpitch_0.wav|You're all in good spirits. They might retreat and leave the pickets.
p066_freeform_speech_04_29.wav|I like to use the dropper because, again, there's dust on there, and I don't want dust to contaminate my brush,
p046_freeform_speech_01_6.wav|But yeah, it just seems to me that city life would definitely be more my style.
p020_freeform_speech_03_2.wav|All right.
p069_freeform_speech_04_17.wav|in my coffee. And when I used to try flavored coffee, I would have to drink a lot of sugar
p010_freeform_speech_01_30.wav|what you're capable of
p056_sentences_11_highpitch_1.wav|They might retreat and leave the pickets.
p066_freeform_speech_05_35.wav|So now it's time to polish.
p077_freeform_speech_01_27.wav|maybe Link Wray, stuff like that. Something that you might really hear in a Quentin Tarantino movie.
p106_emo_contentment_sentences_3.wav|I'm good either way.
p015_sentences_20_regular_4.wav|This must be stopped at once.
p001_freeform_speech_06_45.wav|So you double your chances of getting fish.
p084_emo_amusement_sentences_1.wav|I like that stand-up comic. I found it pretty funny.
p060_freeform_speech_04_20.wav|And I can't allow a big guy to get a grip on me like that either.
p032_sentences_06_loud_4.wav|Birthdays are of no importance to a rational being.
p102_freeform_speech_02_38.wav|That's what I mean.
p061_sentences_01_fast_0.wav|i will not stay here god we simply must dress the character stay stay i will go myself may one ask what it is for he rushed to the window and opened the movable pane
p019_sentences_01_lowpitch_0.wav|I will not stay here. God, we simply must dress the character. Stay, stay. I will go myself. May one ask what it is for? He rushed to the window and opened the movable pane.
p087_freeform_speech_02_21.wav|Our gardening has been terrible though.
p006_sentences_07_slow_4.wav|He seemed almost afraid of something.
p094_freeform_speech_02_24.wav|But so you, you know, you buy a ticket and they take you on this little boat,
p080_sentences_01_whisper_0.wav|I will not stay here. God, we simply must dress the character. Stay, stay. I will go myself.
p091_freeform_speech_01_19.wav|or going to the club or to a bar.
p107_freeform_speech_02_40.wav|But this time you never know.
p028_freeform_speech_03_17.wav|seasons out right now, and I, I don't know if I made it past eight the first time around, or ten.
p016_freeform_speech_01_34.wav|I can jump on it.
p082_sentences_01_whisper_4.wav|He rushed to the window and opened the movable pane.
p020_emo_sadness_sentences_3.wav|It gets better soon.
p104_freeform_speech_05_28.wav|And I, I never really thought I would finish it, but I wanted, my goal was to finish four songs.
p027_freeform_speech_02_58.wav|I couldn't imagine
p071_sentences_18_regular_4.wav|Then she gave him the dry bread.
p008_emo_disappointment_sentences_3.wav|I really was hoping you were better than this.
p042_freeform_speech_01_0.wav|All right, so I'm gonna start talking about things I'm interesting about. I'm interested about, sorry.
p032_sentences_15_regular_4.wav|I didn't tell a tale.

p078_freeform_speech_05_14.wav|two or three weeks later. Um, so it's nice to see everybody even if it's not all at the same time.
p047_sentences_24_regular_3.wav|But they wouldn't leave me alone.
p072_freeform_speech_02_23.wav|The DFS, which is basically the American CIA.
p019_emo_serenity_freeform_1.wav|And I might take a dip later, I might not.
p059_freeform_speech_02_9.wav|Different coffee shops have different kinds of milks.
p034_emo_disgust_freeform_0.wav|Ew, I don't know what that is.
p099_freeform_speech_01_21.wav|But it's cool.
p078_freeform_speech_02_25.wav|So I need to pick that up from them at some point today.
p061_emo_interest_freeform_0.wav|I'd really like to learn how to decorate cakes.

p079_sentences_02_regular_4.wav|Who wants a dead search for the gold cup?
p097_sentences_11_highpitch_0.wav|You're all in good spirits. They might retreat and leave the pickets. But I like sentimental
p031_freeform_speech_05_44.wav|but, uh, I don't know.
p100_freeform_speech_02_2.wav|retrospect was a bad idea because it took off some of the paint and now I have to do some touch-up
p029_emo_fear_sentences_2.wav|Oh my gosh, what is that?
p063_sentences_01_highpitch_1.wav|Stay, stay, I will go myself. May one ask what it is for?
p057_sentences_03_whisper_0.wav|Had it been but one, it had been easy.
p072_freeform_speech_01_25.wav|and more crazier every day it seems. I could understand.
p044_freeform_speech_03_2.wav|Um, and the movie was about his life.
p003_freeform_speech_04_11.wav|thought the black sand was really cool and it's really picturesque. Like something you'd see is a

p023_sentences_20_regular_1.wav|The expression of her face was cold.
p052_sentences_15_regular_0.wav|They were all sitting in her room.
p083_freeform_speech_01_39.wav|I love music.
p089_emo_anger_sentences_1.wav|I can't believe he said that. He's such a jerk.
p087_freeform_speech_06_7.wav|And this was the worst dog.
p005_freeform_speech_03_10.wav|I found out I'm quite...
p095_sentences_01_regular_0.wav|I will not stay here. God, we simply must dress the character. Stay, stay. I will go myself.
p093_freeform_speech_01_21.wav|tends to do those same types of things, so it's just a fun thing to do.
p021_freeform_speech_02_11.wav|I cook and I bake, you know, I do.
p084_freeform_speech_04_3.wav|But they should be a good time.
p065_emo_realization_freeform_4.wav|One quarter of your bones are in your feet.
p037_sentences_01_fast_3.wav|"'May one ask what it is for?'
p106_sentences_02_slow_4.wav|Who wants a dead cert for the gold cup?
p002_freeform_speech_06_22.wav|with you
p035_freeform_speech_02_10.wav|That's going to be every upper body, all of that movement.
p056_sentences_01_slow_2.wav|Stay, stay, I will go myself.

p079_sentences_21_regular_2.wav|Every word is so deep.
p070_emo_cuteness_freeform_1.wav|Look at them cuddling that tiny baby with that floofy, puffy dog.
p064_sentences_22_regular_0.wav|It seemed that sleep and night had resumed their empire.
p107_freeform_speech_03_23.wav|but it wasn't hard actually i expected it to be hard according to the feedback from other hikers
p002_freeform_speech_06_34.wav|all that stuff
p091_freeform_speech_04_42.wav|but it's just hot out there and it's, you get the drier weather out there.
p026_sentences_01_slow_2.wav|Stay, stay.
p039_sentences_14_lowpitch_2.wav|What a cabin it is.
p085_emo_extasy_freeform_0.wav|You will never believe it. I just won the lottery. I never win anything and this is huge. I needed the cash and I decided to play for once and here we are. I've got the cash. Just don't tell anybody because I'm going to need it and I don't want to be doling it out to everybody.
p009_emo_amusement_freeform_1.wav|It looks like a Jack Russell butt.
p068_emo_fear_sentences_2.wav|What do you think is going to happen if we don't run?
p092_emo_amazement_sentences_2.wav|I admire your abilities so much.
p002_freeform_speech_01_10.wav|I would do two, then up to four.
p098_emo_adoration_freeform_1.wav|You're so great.
p055_freeform_speech_02_43.wav|that we didn't feel confident enough to navigate and

p057_freeform_speech_06_23.wav|But Penn State also, they're going to be starting next year

p037_emo_extasy_sentences_2.wav|I am so excited.
p081_freeform_speech_04_12.wav|magic and it would have looked like this.
p022_freeform_speech_03_43.wav|You know, we didn't throw to the middle of the field.
p016_freeform_speech_01_9.wav|On that same New River trip I mentioned, that went on a couple years ago when I first decided to become an officer and contribute that.
p048_freeform_speech_04_14.wav|mate it was homemade snow from
p001_freeform_speech_03_8.wav|conversation so that seems to be a massive burden
p076_emo_disgust_sentences_1.wav|This is the worst dinner I've ever had.
p042_freeform_speech_05_16.wav|Uh, so yeah, I mean, you can also do voice acting, uh, deep thinking.
p053_freeform_speech_06_0.wav|I was in a lot of fun shows throughout the years when I was a dancer.
p074_sentences_06_loud_3.wav|Happy to say I never knew him.
p067_freeform_speech_03_23.wav|and the environment actually affects the person so it also affects me so i become
p040_sentences_11_highpitch_0.wav|You're all in good spirits. They might retreat and leave the pickets.
p046_emo_relief_freeform_1.wav|I am so happy that's over with.
p030_emo_pride_freeform_0.wav|Oh my goodness, I'm so proud of you.
p014_sentences_21_regular_4.wav|Death is now, perhaps, striking a fourth blow.
p039_sentences_23_regular_0.wav|It is nevertheless conclusive to my mind.
p010_emo_neutral_sentences_1.wav|That wall in the living room is white.
p086_freeform_speech_06_20.wav|God, so good.
p096_emo_amazement_freeform_1.wav|You know, I wish I could play like that. You should teach me sometime.
p022_freeform_speech_03_28.wav|So, you know, what's it going to take to make this team better?
p002_freeform_speech_02_2.wav|more Christmas music I like pop I like I'm starting to like Taylor Swift a lot
p035_emo_disappointment_sentences_3.wav|I was really hoping you were better than this.
p050_emo_contentment_freeform_2.wav|Maybe I'll...
p065_emo_amazement_sentences_1.wav|You are so impressive.
p008_emo_neutral_freeform_2.wav|And I'll be waking up in eight hours to go to work and do the
p063_sentences_01_slow_0.wav|I will not stay here.
p055_freeform_speech_04_20.wav|It's never cold if you have the right gear.
p099_sentences_22_regular_1.wav|The snowstorm was still raging, but we'll talk later on.
p031_freeform_speech_01_5.wav|have been coming out, there's been good ones, but there's nothing that's been like, you know,
p052_sentences_01_slow_0.wav|I will not stay here. God, we simply must dress the character. Stay, stay. I will go myself.
p094_freeform_speech_04_36.wav|I think cars now are in the U.S. are getting a little bit more high tech, the U.S. and
p034_freeform_speech_04_36.wav|Some people go out 10, 11, 12, 1.
p047_sentences_01_loud_3.wav|May one ask what it is for?
p015_emo_neutral_freeform_1.wav|And then I lay down and try to sleep.
p070_sentences_01_whisper_2.wav|Stay, stay, I will go myself.
p066_freeform_speech_01_35.wav|So you're going to go ahead and put the glue on that etched nail tip and then rock it from
p077_sentences_23_regular_0.wav|It is nevertheless conclusive to my mind. Give this to the Countess. It is only a question of
p047_freeform_speech_02_18.wav|There's all different songs. All have different
p090_freeform_speech_02_6.wav|but I just don't want to see Kansas City win again.
p073_sentences_01_slow_0.wav|I will not stay here.
p031_freeform_speech_01_19.wav|under its budget, and we're never gonna get another movie like it, which is super disappointing,
p052_sentences_04_whisper_0.wav|I only heard it last night. We had now gotten into the month of March, but go thy ways. I had forgot. Conceited fellow with his waxed-up mustache. And unhappiness continued for the week.
p091_emo_serenity_freeform_0.wav|ah it's so nice just sitting here in front of this beautiful lake i feel all relaxed and calm just taking in the scenes the beautiful view
p029_freeform_speech_03_26.wav|the back of them and then i'll put them all on the walls to make it look like there's actual snow
p102_freeform_speech_06_51.wav|So I am looking forward to the possibility of just like, you want to take a train to Belgium, see where they shot in Bruges?
p053_sentences_07_slow_2.wav|He was still in sight.
p028_freeform_speech_01_16.wav|We're only going to useencial doggies to walk on
p062_emo_serenity_freeform_0.wav|Oh my gosh, this lakeside is just so beautiful, so relaxing.
p026_freeform_speech_03_56.wav|Like they gave us the taste,
p028_freeform_speech_05_1.wav|a hobby I think so um I think reading's become a lot bigger recently because of TikTok um I think
p087_emo_fear_sentences_0.wav|Did you hear that sound?
p018_sentences_01_slow_5.wav|He rushed to the window and opened the movable pane.
p053_freeform_speech_05_3.wav|When I was a kid, my grandparents used to give my siblings and I, instead of birthday presents, they would enroll us for some kind of class.
p075_freeform_speech_04_28.wav|but a lot of people can say that they they went far in the water even though other people's far
p061_emo_neutral_freeform_1.wav|Sometimes it keeps me up a little bit later and I'm tired in the morning,
p074_freeform_speech_05_18.wav|and wake up to this, like, mountaintop sunset, which is really cool.
p015_sentences_01_slow_5.wav|He rushed to the window.
p040_emo_pride_sentences_1.wav|I've worked hard to get here, and I deserve it. I'm really proud of how well you did.
p034_freeform_speech_01_23.wav|I actually buy gifts all year.
p048_sentences_20_regular_2.wav|Besides, what on earth could happen to you?
p100_freeform_speech_03_27.wav|And everybody's just trying to do their best and make it happy, make it happen and stay
p050_sentences_18_regular_0.wav|How could I have said it more directly?
p082_freeform_speech_01_30.wav|but yeah
p093_freeform_speech_01_25.wav|That's like a medium-sized venue.
p066_emo_amazement_sentences_2.wav|I admire your ability so much.
p093_freeform_speech_02_2.wav|But we always get good seats, like if we go down to PPG Paints Arena.
p037_freeform_speech_03_29.wav|Um, but no hiking is just great. I hope to go, um, over, I'll to Utah and hike there.
p099_emo_distress_freeform_0.wav|Oh my god, I have so much on my plate, so much on my mind.
p047_freeform_speech_06_47.wav|Doesn't know if anybody brought a knife yet.
p075_freeform_speech_01_54.wav|So I want to go everywhere.
p057_freeform_speech_06_5.wav|hasn't beat Michigan since...
p068_freeform_speech_06_4.wav|into any of those places and be like one of the main people that plays especially on the weekends
p046_freeform_speech_03_18.wav|seen a million times, I know it's comforting to me, it'll relax me, and I can just kind of
p054_sentences_03_whisper_2.wav|I shall rush out and prevent it.
p083_freeform_speech_01_49.wav|Just about anything.
p016_sentences_15_regular_3.wav|Why don't you speak, cousin?
p047_sentences_18_regular_2.wav|My kingdom for a drink.
p095_sentences_09_fast_4.wav|I want to tell you something.
p022_emo_sadness_sentences_4.wav|I'm sorry for your loss.
p036_emo_pride_sentences_2.wav|I'm really proud of how well you did.
p093_sentences_24_regular_2.wav|The weakness of a murderer.
p061_sentences_01_lowpitch_1.wav|God, we simply must dress the character.
p080_freeform_speech_05_50.wav|My brother, uh, for example, he has a Great Dane.
p019_freeform_speech_01_0.wav|All right. Presently, I'm reading Competitive Strategy by Michael E. Porter, which is a book about competitive strategy, surprisingly.
p004_freeform_speech_01_35.wav|as the background to show the sunset fading. You can have different
p042_freeform_speech_03_3.wav|they have a lot of different flavors they have this fruit called um lucuma i think that's so nice
p083_sentences_01_slow_0.wav|I will not stay here.
p059_emo_amazement_freeform_5.wav|I would love to learn from you.
p071_sentences_07_slow_3.wav|He delayed.
p024_emo_embarassment_freeform_0.wav|Oh, I didn't even mean it. I'm so sorry. I didn't... Why are you still pointing at me? I didn't even do the thing that you thought that I did. I just feel so... Please stop pointing at me and looking at me and I just feel...
p002_freeform_speech_02_28.wav|holiday concert or something? Is it this year? Yeah, that, that would be pretty neat to see.
p064_sentences_01_loud_0.wav|I will not stay here. God, we simply must dress the character. Stay, stay. I will go myself.
p012_freeform_speech_04_23.wav|I personally like my rice very fluffy, so I will make sure to leave it on as long as possible.
p009_sentences_01_loud_4.wav|He rushed to the window and opened the movable pane.
p086_freeform_speech_03_25.wav|Like, everybody was super cool.
p030_emo_adoration_sentences_1.wav|I had the best time with you I just adore you I love this gift thank you
p004_freeform_speech_02_19.wav|I never thought that people would be so excited to receive something in the mail that I made, which makes me super happy.
p059_freeform_speech_01_30.wav|talking to her about that, but I just felt like I was doing a good job. And, um, I think that's
p008_emo_realization_freeform_0.wav|oh wow dolphins sleep with one eye open that's totally amazing to hear about i didn't know that i wonder what that one eye is watching or if it's just open and they're not actually asleep and they're trying to pretend that they are
p077_sentences_02_loud_1.wav|It is sold, sir, was again his laconic reply.
p066_freeform_speech_01_30.wav|And then when you're finished, what also helps is if you etch the inside of the nail tip
p105_sentences_10_fast_3.wav|Before going away forever, I'll tell him all.
p061_sentences_02_loud_3.wav|What is that flying about?
p064_emo_pride_sentences_1.wav|I have worked hard to get here and I deserve it. I'm really proud of how well you did.
p079_sentences_16_regular_3.wav|I have done my duty.
p106_freeform_speech_06_25.wav|by a calendar. I don't know how this happened. It happens to me. But first, even going back to old
p058_freeform_speech_03_12.wav|We were out of our house for two weeks. Um, but whenever we got back, I, I think before we left,
p016_emo_amazement_sentences_0.wav|I just love how you can play guitar.
p029_emo_distress_sentences_0.wav|Oh my god, I'm not sure if we're going to make this flight on time.
p054_emo_confusion_freeform_0.wav|Wow, that elephant is really big.
p055_freeform_speech_02_24.wav|I like to wear a wetsuit in the fall when I kayak because it gets a little cold.
p064_freeform_speech_01_47.wav|That's one.
p028_emo_relief_freeform_2.wav|but I am so glad that they did not give me the ticket and that it's off my record.
p046_emo_neutral_freeform_3.wav|I'll just make sure my alarm's set,
p035_freeform_speech_03_56.wav|So if you have a stronger left hemisphere, it makes sense why you're right-handed.
p090_emo_embarassment_freeform_2.wav|Guys, stop it.
p074_emo_amazement_sentences_2.wav|I admire your abilities so much.
p025_emo_confusion_freeform_2.wav|Is this supposed to be other pictures inside this elephant?
p071_emo_amazement_sentences_0.wav|I just love how you can play guitar.
p023_freeform_speech_03_2.wav|so you never really feel too lonely. There's so many things to do, so many cool things to kind of get into.
p077_freeform_speech_06_10.wav|and I move it to a stable build channel so that it can then be used by the rest of the team for testing or further development processes.
p017_sentences_03_whisper_2.wav|I shall rush out and prevent it.
p037_emo_adoration_freeform_3.wav|Just having your love and having you in my life is all I ever would need and what I would ever want.
p040_emo_disappointment_freeform_6.wav|I'll just try again harder
p033_sentences_20_regular_0.wav|I never could guess a riddle in my life.
p015_sentences_15_regular_0.wav|They were all sitting in her room, so that's how it stands.
p024_sentences_21_regular_4.wav|Death is now, perhaps, striking a fourth blow.
p003_sentences_09_fast_0.wav|And it seemed to her that God heard her prayer.
p102_freeform_speech_04_46.wav|They still have some values there, but I also don't want to have diarrhea all day, so yeah,
p105_sentences_17_regular_4.wav|Oh, he couldn't overhear me at the door.
p026_freeform_speech_05_24.wav|we did not get paid. And one time, I think it was before the race, I was at the stadium,
p049_freeform_speech_05_13.wav|Okay, I'm going to listen, buddy.
p024_freeform_speech_02_16.wav|And I continue because I want to stay who I am and not get away from the things that have set me free.
p049_freeform_speech_04_37.wav|it.
p067_freeform_speech_05_6.wav|me now to change as a just habit as a grown-up person and i've tried to to adjust to this
p064_freeform_speech_06_28.wav|But.
p047_freeform_speech_06_46.wav|Cop doesn't know who was in the fight.
p056_sentences_02_whisper_0.wav|it might happen he added with an involuntary smile it is sold sir was again his laconic reply
p045_sentences_01_loud_1.wav|God, we simply must dress the character.
p086_emo_pain_sentences_2.wav|I'm in terrible pain from that medication.
p011_emo_fear_freeform_1.wav|Can you please go check? Please go check. I don't want to go downstairs. I don't have any
p019_freeform_speech_04_32.wav|because Bernard Edwards, I think, was the bass player.
p085_freeform_speech_01_19.wav|I'm also able to, if I'm lucky, curve the ball.
p091_emo_cuteness_freeform_0.wav|oh look how cute that baby is with that teddy bear he looks so comfortable and cozy they're
p004_emo_disgust_sentences_1.wav|This is the worst dinner I've ever had.
p088_freeform_speech_05_6.wav|He was in Fallout New Vegas, which I didn't find out until after he died.
p052_emo_contentment_sentences_1.wav|I'm good either way.
p093_freeform_speech_01_23.wav|I still call it the Civic Arena because these places have changed names so many times.
p059_sentences_12_highpitch_2.wav|The knocking still continued and grew louder.
p023_emo_interest_freeform_1.wav|Yeah, no, I didn't know that much about Joyce Carol Oates, but look at me.
p101_freeform_speech_06_67.wav|originate from. That's why.
p095_freeform_speech_02_44.wav|Okay.
p097_sentences_01_whisper_0.wav|I will not stay here. God, we simply must dress the character. Stay, stay, I will go myself.
p096_emo_disappointment_freeform_1.wav|i i can't believe i didn't get it i i worked so hard to get here
p076_emo_amusement_sentences_1.wav|I liked that stand-up comic. I found her pretty funny.
p075_freeform_speech_03_7.wav|like about trust so I like that show I'm into that show um I like the challenge it's like a whole
p079_sentences_06_loud_2.wav|Silent with awe and pity, I went to her bedside.
p005_freeform_speech_01_46.wav|May I start?
p004_emo_amusement_freeform_0.wav|Look at the puppy so confused.
p027_freeform_speech_02_12.wav|Seafood, of course,
p056_sentences_14_lowpitch_0.wav|there was a catch in her breath they told me but i didn't understand what a cabin it is a cry of joy broke from his lips he had obviously prepared the sentence beforehand
p014_emo_amusement_sentences_3.wav|What a fun little show to watch.
p072_emo_extasy_sentences_3.wav|I've never been there before.
p056_sentences_01_regular_4.wav|He rushed to the window and opened the movable pane.
p030_freeform_speech_06_37.wav|Yeah.
p100_freeform_speech_01_18.wav|there's Halloween I can do my decorating I guess there's like what else happens in the fall
p005_sentences_01_loud_2.wav|Stay, stay. I will go myself.
p094_sentences_22_regular_1.wav|The snowstorm was still raging.
p098_emo_pride_freeform_4.wav|I didn't even have to tell you because I knew you was going to love this.
p092_freeform_speech_02_28.wav|Protégé.
p033_freeform_speech_05_0.wav|That is a really tough one. When I travel, I see beauty in so many things. So each hike I go on,

p090_freeform_speech_05_44.wav|Right.
p044_sentences_17_regular_1.wav|He is a deceiver and a villain, but those tears were pleasant to them both.

p006_freeform_speech_06_15.wav|really good you make the avocado ranch um you could just buy it at the store and then you put
p018_freeform_speech_04_10.wav|here in Pittsburgh, and that was a long time ago. I've also seen her in some other shows.
p077_freeform_speech_05_41.wav|But it is a little relaxing if you're not trying to beat a thunderstorm.
p002_emo_distress_sentences_2.wav|I don't know where anything is and I'm running late.
p092_emo_cuteness_sentences_0.wav|Look at that cute little kitty cat.
p060_sentences_01_whisper_3.wav|May one ask what it is for?
p045_emo_cuteness_sentences_2.wav|That's the cutest thing I've ever seen.
p006_emo_sadness_freeform_2.wav|Because he just wants to be adopted and be left out of there.
p090_emo_contentment_freeform_2.wav|I don't know.

p012_emo_desire_freeform_0.wav|Oh my god, these desserts look so good and they're creamy and they look perfectly sculpted
p039_freeform_speech_03_15.wav|But the Z06 had the difference of having a supercharger.
p065_emo_disgust_sentences_0.wav|I've never seen anything grosser than this in my entire life.
p072_emo_cuteness_freeform_0.wav|Oh my gosh, that puppy is so much cuter than that baby.
p087_freeform_speech_03_10.wav|it's so funny.
p081_freeform_speech_05_17.wav|And I eventually decided to quit because I was doing a gig and I got tipped $90. And I remember looking at it and thinking I could use it.
p045_sentences_08_slow_2.wav|Now look at that third name and serve them both right, too.
p065_sentences_02_whisper_4.wav|Who wants a dead cert for the gold cup?
p009_sentences_20_regular_2.wav|Besides, what on earth could happen to you?
p032_sentences_02_slow_4.wav|Who wants a dead cert for the gold cup?
p007_emo_amusement_freeform_0.wav|I'm gonna draw all over his face while he's sleeping
p098_emo_interest_sentences_0.wav|Hmm, wonder what that cookie tastes like.
p049_emo_sadness_freeform_2.wav|He doesn't have any food or water in his dish, and a really uncomfortable bed.
p082_sentences_21_regular_2.wav|Every word is so deep.
p099_freeform_speech_05_86.wav|Somebody know where you at.
p065_freeform_speech_02_33.wav|as far as, like, dust and things like that.
p058_sentences_18_regular_0.wav|How could I have said it more directly?
p046_freeform_speech_03_4.wav|I just can't force myself, or I don't, I don't know, maybe I just don't have the discipline enough to
p059_emo_amazement_freeform_0.wav|Oh my gosh, you're that guy.
p026_freeform_speech_03_11.wav|so I decided that I wanted to go.
p101_emo_neutral_freeform_0.wav|10 o'clock, I watch the 10 o'clock news.
p023_freeform_speech_04_57.wav|So...
p087_emo_adoration_freeform_0.wav|well, I can just tell you that I wouldn't want to be with anybody but you.
p031_emo_desire_freeform_3.wav|I don't know if I'm allowed to take them.
p013_freeform_speech_01_12.wav|like there are a bunch of pictures so you can just read it's like around you know like 100
p003_freeform_speech_06_24.wav|hopefully that means they try to switch things up because I feel like the Bachelor is basically
p095_emo_disappointment_sentences_1.wav|I wish I had worked harder.
p035_freeform_speech_02_31.wav|Maybe you've heard before that your brain isn't fully developed until a certain age.
p071_sentences_10_fast_1.wav|I am very glad to see you.
p035_freeform_speech_03_13.wav|So your Broca's area is basically like your production of speech.
p087_sentences_02_lowpitch_0.wav|"'It might happen,' he added with an involuntary smile.
p042_emo_extasy_freeform_1.wav|I'm gonna be able to do everything I wanted, I'm gonna be able to help my family,
p077_freeform_speech_01_11.wav|gigging out around.
p050_freeform_speech_04_49.wav|And.
p012_emo_sadness_sentences_1.wav|I really miss her. Life isn't the same without her. I'm so sorry for your loss.
p090_sentences_05_loud_0.wav|In fact, the Count's face brightened.
p107_freeform_speech_05_27.wav|I also bring reflective blinky lights.
p102_emo_neutral_freeform_0.wav|Okay, just gonna check the news again.
p006_emo_embarassment_freeform_2.wav|Do I have something in my hair?
p064_sentences_20_regular_1.wav|The expression on her face was cold.
p064_freeform_speech_05_34.wav|Like, the SVU one, the lady, she's, I mean, she's been on it for, oh, Jesus, 20-something years.
p072_emo_interest_sentences_0.wav|Hmm, I wonder what that cookie tastes like.
p063_sentences_02_lowpitch_2.wav|cert for the gold cup
p045_sentences_01_loud_4.wav|May one ask what it is for?
p060_sentences_22_regular_2.wav|But we'll talk later on.
p067_sentences_13_lowpitch_0.wav|just read it out to me i shall take your advice in every particular what mortal imagination could conceive it the gate was again hidden by smoke after a while i left them
p088_emo_extasy_freeform_0.wav|Woo! Won the lottery!
p034_freeform_speech_02_42.wav|I couldn't get it to roll.
p053_emo_distress_freeform_1.wav|I'm on a time crunch and too many things keep getting handed and piled onto me. I don't know if-
p065_sentences_13_lowpitch_0.wav|just read it out to me i shall take your advice in every particular what moral imagination could conceive it the gate was again hidden by smoke after a while i left him
p060_emo_amazement_sentences_1.wav|You're so impressive.
p058_sentences_08_slow_5.wav|Take away that.
p056_freeform_speech_03_6.wav|Um, but, but now, I mean, like, as it goes on, you realize he, he actually enjoys what he does. And that is, um, he, he doesn't think it's, he, he doesn't think it's right though. He doesn't think it's like a morally good thing to keep killing people, but the people in his life too, that are like his manager and then like the bosses, um,
p101_sentences_01_whisper_3.wav|Stay, stay, I will go myself.
p002_freeform_speech_01_38.wav|It's just something I fell in love with and will continue to do as long as I can.
p047_emo_pride_sentences_0.wav|That was all me. I'm the one who found the project, created the company, and made it succeed.
p028_sentences_01_slow_2.wav|Stay, stay. I will go myself.
p019_sentences_17_regular_1.wav|He is a deceiver and a villain.
p016_freeform_speech_06_14.wav|alternate universes are the people whose story we've been heard the whole time like this fake
p014_emo_amazement_sentences_1.wav|You're so impressive.
p054_freeform_speech_03_47.wav|I couldn't see a lot too many people doing it
p096_freeform_speech_01_7.wav|Like my parents, for instance, they say it's spoofy.
p071_emo_anger_sentences_1.wav|I can't believe he said that. He's such a jerk.
p068_freeform_speech_01_14.wav|So basically, we were just eating bread and cheese for two weeks.
p066_freeform_speech_03_27.wav|And again, the same thing with that first ball and just let it glaze over a little bit.
p035_emo_extasy_sentences_2.wav|I'm so excited, I've never been there before.
p060_sentences_02_fast_1.wav|"'It is sold, sir,' was again his laconic reply.
p077_freeform_speech_03_8.wav|as long as the weather doesn't destroy us. But 90 percent of the time, I'll be riding in the
p059_sentences_01_highpitch_3.wav|May one ask what it is for?
p028_freeform_speech_04_15.wav|Bone on Netflix, uh, I heard it was not renewed for another season, which is sad. I read the books,
p106_sentences_01_regular_4.wav|He rushed to the window and opened the movable pane.
p041_emo_distress_sentences_2.wav|I don't know where anything is and I'm running late.
p074_sentences_24_regular_3.wav|But they wouldn't leave me alone.
p050_freeform_speech_04_34.wav|And let's see.
p090_sentences_16_regular_2.wav|I have only found out.
p040_freeform_speech_04_6.wav|the frozen section in a grocery store and just trying to like use the cold ice cream to kind of
p022_emo_contentment_sentences_1.wav|Everything's working out just fine.
p061_sentences_17_regular_4.wav|Oh, he couldn't overhear me at the door.
p010_freeform_speech_01_8.wav|feet up no cares in the world seeing things that you'll never see experiencing new people new ideas
p015_emo_anger_freeform_1.wav|Oh, so now you're going to ride my butt here.
p066_emo_realization_sentences_0.wav|Wow, I never realized that the body was made up of 75% water.
p103_sentences_08_slow_0.wav|But I have never been presented.
p049_freeform_speech_06_59.wav|and it's something you have to learn for yourself.
p032_emo_contentment_sentences_1.wav|Everything's working out just fine.
p018_emo_fear_freeform_9.wav|Oh, I don't know.
p035_freeform_speech_05_37.wav|But yeah, that's the hypothalamus.
p051_freeform_speech_05_5.wav|I started to travel and I fell in love with the beach and I would go to
p025_sentences_01_slow_3.wav|May one ask what it is for?
p078_freeform_speech_03_18.wav|going to go camping.
p071_sentences_02_slow_1.wav|It is sold, sir, was again his laconic reply.
p077_freeform_speech_05_49.wav|People will start complaining.
p006_emo_extasy_freeform_2.wav|Everything. Yes. This is awesome
p047_sentences_09_fast_1.wav|My word, I admire you.
p073_freeform_speech_03_4.wav|I also think that jeans are boring um I don't like when sweatpants have like a
p014_freeform_speech_03_28.wav|Those were my favorite.
p087_emo_amusement_freeform_2.wav|Wait till he wakes up.
p045_freeform_speech_01_22.wav|It was a binge-watch.
p030_freeform_speech_05_11.wav|probably the birth of both my daughters
p061_emo_confusion_sentences_0.wav|Huh, what's going on over there? What is it? Where are we going?
p005_sentences_01_highpitch_3.wav|Meiyuan asked what it is for.
p006_sentences_12_highpitch_2.wav|The knocking still continued and grew louder.
p082_emo_contentment_sentences_0.wav|I really enjoyed dinner tonight. It was quite nice.
p030_freeform_speech_02_34.wav|So pretty.
p048_sentences_21_regular_1.wav|So you were never in London before? Death is now, perhaps, striking a fourth blow.
p096_emo_interest_freeform_2.wav|Well, I never knew that.
p009_emo_cuteness_freeform_0.wav|It's a little baby and a fluffy dog. I got one
p082_freeform_speech_02_19.wav|Ah, A24 has done Uncut Gems with Adam Sandler. Uh, edge of your seat the whole time. Sweating
p059_emo_distress_freeform_1.wav|on time. I feel so overwhelmed right now. No one is helping me. Everyone's ignoring
p072_freeform_speech_03_14.wav|read and entertain myself so in the morning if I am working for a company or
p082_sentences_05_loud_4.wav|I heard many things in hell.
p049_freeform_speech_05_29.wav|there was this massive mind derailment
p072_emo_anger_freeform_1.wav|It's like 150 miles of dead stop. I'm always late.
p034_emo_embarassment_sentences_1.wav|I hope no one saw that. I'd be so mortified if they did.
p068_freeform_speech_01_27.wav|Okay.
p073_freeform_speech_03_1.wav|floor like kind of tempted to test out like it's like a trampoline bouncy like that I don't know
p073_freeform_speech_05_4.wav|I mean, I guess you can do that.
p042_emo_cuteness_freeform_2.wav|So cute.
p074_freeform_speech_05_24.wav|My mother was nice.
p061_freeform_speech_03_49.wav|And the station posted him, of course.

p056_freeform_speech_04_5.wav|uh Bill of course is like he's overseeing all of it but there's this one that he like directed and
p096_freeform_speech_02_6.wav|like my friends are like oh well you know i quit watching after the one person died in the show
p096_freeform_speech_05_25.wav|Those are my favorite type of games.

p050_sentences_19_regular_1.wav|Water was being sprinkled on his face.
p016_freeform_speech_02_20.wav|So if you're not good at aiming, you're probably not going to be good at the game.
p021_freeform_speech_02_5.wav|And she said, you know what, go ahead and take her, and if it works out, then we'll do the adoption.
p042_freeform_speech_01_38.wav|I know that's like a long shot for Fortnite.

p075_emo_disgust_sentences_0.wav|I've never seen anything grosser than this in my entire life.

p009_sentences_14_lowpitch_2.wav|What a cabin it is.
p013_emo_relief_sentences_1.wav|That was so stressful.
p019_emo_amusement_freeform_3.wav|I've actually seen a dog do that and bark at the dog's butt and just lose its mind over
p017_freeform_speech_04_24.wav|I tried to explain to him that I wasn't the scuba man but my jet ski was just eaten by a shark
p009_freeform_speech_05_40.wav|To prove your strength.

p061_emo_extasy_sentences_1.wav|I can't believe I got to see that.
p070_freeform_speech_02_27.wav|Her biggest things for why she can't be alone is just the inability to know how to respond
p081_freeform_speech_04_16.wav|But I wasn't happy.
p019_emo_pride_freeform_3.wav|And you just, there was one point
p073_freeform_speech_04_8.wav|like, all pasta, fettuccine alfredo, penne, elbow, macaroni,
p077_sentences_02_slow_1.wav|It is sold, sir, was again his laconic reply.

p046_emo_fear_freeform_5.wav|Who could this guy be?
p032_sentences_06_loud_0.wav|Yes, but we do not invite people of fashion.
p037_freeform_speech_03_13.wav|the birds, the bugs. Occasionally you would see a bear or a snake, not too fond of that though.

p008_sentences_02_whisper_0.wav|It might happen, he added with an involuntary smile.
p102_sentences_01_slow_1.wav|May one ask what it is for? He rushed to the window and opened the movable pane.

p086_freeform_speech_03_33.wav|Uh, also, like, all the people there are so sick of tourists.
p031_freeform_speech_03_53.wav|Because Genshin Impact has such a huge community of people who love the characters,
p071_emo_sadness_sentences_2.wav|I'm sorry for your loss.
p062_freeform_speech_06_57.wav|It was just so freaking early.
p020_freeform_speech_05_4.wav|So there's a lot of deals coming up and down after dark. So I guess a deal went to pass on the street and there was a car also passing by.

p083_freeform_speech_01_33.wav|Somebody's trying to talk me into watching something that I don't know anything about anime for real.
p081_emo_guilt_freeform_0.wav|I kind of ripped apart the toilet roll.
p084_emo_pride_sentences_0.wav|That was all me. I'm the one who found the project, created the company, and made it succeed.
p001_freeform_speech_04_26.wav|unrelated to that i have a bunch of artists that i'm friends with like that is like a real thing
p087_freeform_speech_02_18.wav|So I think that's one of my, that would be my summer hobby.
p014_freeform_speech_04_39.wav|And that it was delicious sangria.

p086_freeform_speech_06_21.wav|Very, um, ah, just fun, fun movie.

p063_freeform_speech_01_39.wav|A pinch of sugar.
p005_sentences_01_fast_1.wav|God, we simply must raise the character.

p054_sentences_01_highpitch_1.wav|God, we simply misdressed the character.
p024_freeform_speech_04_11.wav|I like to be able to enjoy the people around me in their authentic ways and not in ways where they're trying to necessarily live the American dream in the suburban life, which you sometimes get.
p089_freeform_speech_05_27.wav|Which was great for me because then I wouldn't feel so bad about not having a pet anymore.

p049_sentences_17_regular_0.wav|I always had a value for him.
p032_freeform_speech_06_71.wav|And, you know, I was sick for about a week.
p066_sentences_23_regular_4.wav|The cool evening air refreshed him.
p011_sentences_01_loud_1.wav|One may ask what it is for. He rushed to the window and opened the movable pane.
p031_freeform_speech_04_2.wav|pick up a bit of Japanese, although I haven't touched in a year, so it's getting a bit rusty,
p049_freeform_speech_02_3.wav|We were scheduled to have dinner at the steakhouse on the boat.

p017_emo_disappointment_freeform_5.wav|I can't believe I didn't get this job.
p030_freeform_speech_02_72.wav|So it's pretty boring.

p087_sentences_23_regular_2.wav|It is only a question of a few hours.
p060_emo_relief_sentences_2.wav|Thank goodness that's all done.
p024_freeform_speech_03_1.wav|I think people consider the spring to be rebirth and I like the spring, but the fall seems to be a good time for people to take a breath after the heat of the summer and be able to start to do the things that they like again.

p060_emo_sadness_freeform_3.wav|Hmm.
p007_freeform_speech_06_8.wav|long distance and sort of being transceived from this Ethernet protocol
p012_emo_disappointment_sentences_0.wav|I'm so disappointed in myself.
p060_freeform_speech_06_18.wav|but it's about being considerate of

p004_emo_anger_freeform_1.wav|You just blew right through it.
p082_freeform_speech_02_27.wav|I think that was Anya Taylor-Joy that was in that. But, yeah. Definitely, definitely a good time.
p083_sentences_03_whisper_3.wav|All that is mean slander.
p056_emo_amazement_freeform_0.wav|That's incredible. How did you learn how to do that? I mean, it's just amazing what you can do. And it's so beautiful. I mean, wow.
p039_sentences_04_whisper_0.wav|I only heard it last night.

p090_emo_adoration_sentences_0.wav|You're just the sweetest person I know, and I'm so happy to call you my friend.
p072_sentences_05_loud_0.wav|In fact, the count's face brightened. For God's sake, talk to her. In what an amiable light does this place him? Take me out of my way. I heard many things in hell.
p031_freeform_speech_04_16.wav|you know, I'm an American, I should probably be drawing heads. But then again,
p075_sentences_02_loud_0.wav|it might happen he added with an involuntary smile it is sold sir was again his laconic reply and you must have some water my dear my dear fellow what is that flying about who wants a dead cert for the gold cup

p067_freeform_speech_06_17.wav|Like I visited the place like more than twice each summer, like every summer.
p046_freeform_speech_03_14.wav|it's kind of a mixed bag for me, depending on how I feel, but mostly, I would say I'm an,

p088_sentences_21_regular_1.wav|You are fond of fighting.
p102_freeform_speech_02_4.wav|Like, so, that's the thing, too. Because of, sort of, the culture that is involved with, like, awards and stuff like that, if it gets a nomination, that must mean it's really good.
p071_emo_realization_sentences_0.wav|Wow, I never knew that the body was made up of 75% water.
p016_sentences_01_regular_2.wav|Stay, stay.

p006_freeform_speech_05_17.wav|It's going to have a really crispy edge.
p003_freeform_speech_02_4.wav|But I think once you're into it, you're really stuck.
p020_freeform_speech_06_45.wav|Let's see.
p053_freeform_speech_01_4.wav|one of my aunt's barn cats and she used to have litters of kittens every year and you know she

p009_emo_amazement_freeform_0.wav|Wow, that is just as amazing. I mean the way you pluck the strings you just
p077_sentences_04_whisper_0.wav|I only heard it last night.
p042_freeform_speech_06_5.wav|potential because unlike movies they can't do literally anything with animation like you can
p074_freeform_speech_04_16.wav|see sheets, and then things can go wrong at a lot of steps in the screen, um, creation where like,
p025_sentences_11_highpitch_3.wav|Our potato crop is very good this year.
p026_sentences_14_lowpitch_4.wav|He had obviously prepared the sentence beforehand.
p077_emo_relief_sentences_0.wav|I'm so relieved my taxes are done.
p076_freeform_speech_03_33.wav|You know, it's, like,
p004_emo_extasy_sentences_0.wav|That is the most exciting thing I've ever seen in my life!
p041_freeform_speech_06_9.wav|um I actually do they have like a bodega but it's like more upscale it's actually really nice um I
p090_freeform_speech_05_52.wav|So hopefully by St. Patrick's Day, the weather will be getting nicer,
p078_emo_sadness_sentences_0.wav|I'm so upset by the state of the world. I hope it gets better soon.
p037_emo_amusement_freeform_2.wav|the dog just staring at the other dog wondering how he can do that he's just looking and looking
p039_sentences_06_loud_2.wav|Silent with awe and pity, I went to her bedside.

p101_emo_anger_sentences_3.wav|There's a stop sign there and parents are just letting their kids run around.
p026_freeform_speech_05_21.wav|stadium, and of course, high five people and take pictures. We also did some outside activities,
p016_emo_interest_freeform_3.wav|The last episode was pretty good.
p046_freeform_speech_04_12.wav|But also, being from an Italian family, it's kind of ingrained in me anyway.
p053_freeform_speech_06_6.wav|One year for Christmas we did The Nutcracker.
p034_freeform_speech_01_8.wav|So a lot of times I'll make very memorable occasions for people
p102_emo_sadness_sentences_0.wav|I am so upset by the state of the world. I hope it gets better soon.
p029_freeform_speech_03_10.wav|where you like cling it to walls and you have to put them back on there I'll use stuff like that
p045_sentences_01_slow_1.wav|God, we simply must stress the character.
p099_emo_amazement_freeform_2.wav|You just play and it just sounds so amazing.
p066_emo_anger_sentences_0.wav|I'm so mad right now I could punch a hole in that wall.
p028_emo_serenity_freeform_1.wav|I wish I could come here every single night and just watch the sunset here. It's the most
p099_sentences_01_loud_3.wav|May one ask, what is this for?
p085_sentences_17_regular_0.wav|I always had a value for him.
p097_freeform_speech_02_7.wav|And the big discouragement was, well, you know, you got to work long hours.
p061_sentences_15_regular_2.wav|He did not know why he embraced it.
p003_freeform_speech_02_21.wav|Solely because I was such a big fan of Game of Thrones.
p090_sentences_02_regular_4.wav|Who wants a dead cert for the gold cup?
p028_freeform_speech_03_26.wav|Lucifer. Lucifer is a good show. Um, I, that's one of the shows that I made it to, like, the last

p054_sentences_01_fast_2.wav|Stay, stay. I will go myself.
p089_freeform_speech_06_9.wav|But I think it's beyond that.
p026_emo_realization_sentences_2.wav|Apparently, dolphins sleep with one eye open.
p102_freeform_speech_01_43.wav|Like, there are some serious, like, Oscar movies that...
p060_freeform_speech_02_28.wav|early especially to leg locks uh if if somebody's pulling on my ankle and i feel it in my knee i
p007_freeform_speech_01_14.wav|have been there, multiple fires, um, so I ended up buying it for, um, you know, really cheap, like
p062_emo_fear_sentences_1.wav|Oh my gosh, what is that? What do you think is going to happen if we don't run?
p016_freeform_speech_02_51.wav|until it started to get closer to the time he had to take them over.

p049_emo_sadness_freeform_3.wav|He just wants out, just let the dog out, somebody, please.

I just, I don't even know who I can ask for help. I just, I don't know what to do. I'm so stressed out right now. I can't.
p019_sentences_15_regular_2.wav|He does not know why he embraced it.

p054_emo_amusement_freeform_0.wav|Where's the rest of this dog at?
p084_freeform_speech_02_0.wav|So we rented a truck, took everything up. The kids had a wonderful time. I try and make things even. Sometimes it works out. Sometimes not so good.
p053_emo_anger_sentences_0.wav|I'm so mad right now I could punch a hole in the wall.
p049_freeform_speech_01_63.wav|And I went down to the jewelry store.

p017_freeform_speech_05_12.wav|it was hit by a truck and totaled, so they had to stop that.
p104_freeform_speech_02_1.wav|But it's really, really an interesting process. I've done walk-ons for local movies, extras for local movies, and that process is also fascinating.
p100_sentences_01_whisper_1.wav|May one ask what it is for? He rushed to the window and opened the movable pane.
p077_freeform_speech_06_7.wav|giving each piece of new functionality its due diligence and verifying that it meets its acceptance criteria.

p079_freeform_speech_06_4.wav|to go to does not have any concession stands or anything like that so when you do go you do have
p030_freeform_speech_06_10.wav|A little bit.
p100_freeform_speech_01_15.wav|my favorite things to do is to do set design and make props and things like that so I don't really

p099_emo_sadness_freeform_1.wav|so much better if you had a family that'll love you i feel so sad for you i wish i had room to
p050_freeform_speech_06_10.wav|So we have a lot more sunlight and I like that too because this time of year,
p082_freeform_speech_04_26.wav|It fits for now. Yeah. I would, I'd like a big dog just like to see the two of them get together.
p017_freeform_speech_01_10.wav|On the way back, we stopped once again in North Carolina.
p049_emo_amazement_freeform_6.wav|I mean, like, could you tell me how you do that?
p014_sentences_01_highpitch_4.wav|He rushed to the window and opened the movable pane.
p058_sentences_01_fast_1.wav|May one ask what it is for? He rushed to the window and opened the movable pane.
p030_freeform_speech_04_1.wav|Yeah, we always like to travel.
p095_emo_neutral_sentences_1.wav|There is one more piece of bread in the pantry.
p037_freeform_speech_01_68.wav|Like you knew which ones she hung outside.
p035_freeform_speech_05_21.wav|But sunlight and waking up, being real fresh in the morning,
p082_sentences_15_regular_3.wav|Why don't you speak, cousin?
p050_freeform_speech_04_36.wav|We don't like holidays that have flags in them because Memorial Day and Labor Day are traditionally the days that we go over and trim the bushes in the yard.
p027_sentences_01_whisper_0.wav|i will not stay here god we simply must dress the character stay stay i will go myself may one ask what it is for he rushed to the window and opened the movable pane
p023_freeform_speech_02_18.wav|like him in that environment would be pretty interesting to be like oh this is what you're
p007_emo_interest_freeform_0.wav|Oh, look at this.
p057_emo_anger_freeform_1.wav|It's 65 and you're going 45!
p039_sentences_01_regular_4.wav|He rushed to the window and opened the movable pane.
p100_freeform_speech_05_3.wav|So I think that's a good measure of, like, if I stumble upon it, or I'm not sure what to watch, it's just one that I can put on. I don't have to watch it all the way through every time, but it's one that I can just put on and sit down and enjoy for a little bit.
p006_sentences_21_regular_0.wav|The lawyer was right about that.
p104_freeform_speech_04_5.wav|um, in the, uh, movies and, and television. So, uh, I haven't yet gotten a placement,
p029_freeform_speech_04_13.wav|I'll just add like different things and then I also have, you can also do, I like my one thing but I gotta fix it is I do boxes.
p013_freeform_speech_06_10.wav|So when I kind of had some German classes at school,
p095_freeform_speech_02_23.wav|Your hand movements with the bench, that push, is pretty much how you're going to try to push an offensive lineman off of you in a game.
p014_sentences_17_regular_3.wav|She conquered her fears and spoke.
p101_freeform_speech_06_25.wav|that, but when I'm with her, we watch movies.
p081_emo_distress_sentences_1.wav|This is all too stressful to handle right now.
p031_emo_disgust_sentences_1.wav|This is the worst dinner I've ever had!
p009_freeform_speech_06_21.wav|look like humans but might have like bird ears they might have like feathers or something like
p044_sentences_02_loud_3.wav|"'What is that flying about?
p052_sentences_12_highpitch_1.wav|May my sorrows ever shun the light. How must I arrange it, then?
p032_emo_amusement_sentences_0.wav|Oh, the sign that baby just made was quite amusing.
p054_freeform_speech_03_70.wav|It's always fun.
p034_emo_guilt_sentences_1.wav|I really didn't mean to hurt you.
p091_freeform_speech_03_12.wav|um, to be a part of that again. Yeah. Cause I think, uh, that's definitely something that's
p048_emo_disgust_freeform_1.wav|That is so gross.
p080_emo_disgust_freeform_0.wav|Ugh, just look at that donut. I just can't believe it's so deceiving. It looks so sweet and innocent, but inside it's just savory with beans. I just don't understand. Why would they make a creation like this? Like, who would eat this? Like, what store would sell this?
p012_freeform_speech_05_30.wav|double-edged sword because it's like, how am I supposed to get experience if y'all don't get,
p002_freeform_speech_03_5.wav|not watched the Friends reunion yet I don't know if I can now after the
p038_sentences_20_regular_0.wav|I never could guess a riddle in my life.
p042_sentences_16_regular_0.wav|My head aches are dreadfully now.
p019_freeform_speech_02_15.wav|Obviously, it's very much through a business lens, because that was his background.
p009_freeform_speech_06_22.wav|it's very like i just it's the science is really cool because they can either
p026_sentences_16_regular_3.wav|He is trying to discover something.
p068_emo_disgust_freeform_1.wav|and gooey and mushy and that's not the kind of surprise you want to find inside of a donut.
p067_emo_realization_sentences_2.wav|Apparently, dolphins sleep with one eye open.
p083_freeform_speech_06_31.wav|I buy for others as well, not just for myself though.
p057_freeform_speech_06_3.wav|but he can't win a big game and hasn't ever.
p061_freeform_speech_01_26.wav|I've heard the book was excellent.
p017_sentences_01_loud_1.wav|God, we simply must dress the character.
p016_sentences_03_whisper_1.wav|We have poxed the compass among us.
p051_freeform_speech_01_49.wav|Okay.
p094_sentences_19_regular_0.wav|Your sister is given to government. Water was being sprinkled on his face.
p051_freeform_speech_05_11.wav|stopping whenever I felt like it and grabbing you know a piece of key lime pie or stopping
p106_freeform_speech_01_12.wav|I empty all the litter boxes, sweep the floor.
p070_sentences_24_regular_4.wav|The telegram was from his wife.
p002_emo_sadness_sentences_0.wav|I am so upset by the state of the world. I hope it gets better soon.
p070_freeform_speech_04_7.wav|He actually was on the news that evening. He was just, he just looked so adorable.
p040_emo_contentment_freeform_3.wav|So, I'm going to let it be what it is.
p064_emo_desire_sentences_1.wav|I want that car so badly.
p080_freeform_speech_05_29.wav|Um, my dog, however, loves, is a homebody.
p102_freeform_speech_04_58.wav|Like, they have...
p020_freeform_speech_04_1.wav|you know there is a specific name for for this I think seedless something I
p040_emo_sadness_freeform_1.wav|badly and most importantly hasn't had any pets that he's loving.
p082_sentences_19_regular_1.wav|Water is being sprinkled on his face.
p016_emo_adoration_freeform_3.wav|Oh, I could get lost in those eyes.
p014_freeform_speech_02_31.wav|And so we got this hocus pocus cookbook and all of like the recipes were like based on hocus pocus.
p074_sentences_18_regular_3.wav|Have they caught the little girl and boy?
p073_freeform_speech_02_30.wav|My friend, Samantha.
p101_freeform_speech_06_70.wav|ancestry.com, that's where my roots
p087_sentences_02_regular_4.wav|"'Who wants a dead cert for the gold cup?'
p052_sentences_08_slow_0.wav|But I have never been presented, but we were only in fun.
p071_sentences_24_regular_4.wav|The telegram was from his wife.
p053_emo_fear_sentences_1.wav|Oh my gosh, what is that?
p033_freeform_speech_06_14.wav|it's not just a place to be it's not just a place to be
p071_freeform_speech_02_7.wav|and yeah
p086_emo_realization_sentences_0.wav|Well, I never knew that the body was made up of 75% water.
p032_freeform_speech_03_44.wav|I'm the baby and I'm pretty old.
p103_freeform_speech_02_11.wav|and I had put too much on my plate, as usual, literally,
p039_emo_realization_sentences_0.wav|Wow, I never knew that the body was made up of 75% water.
p028_sentences_01_regular_0.wav|I will not stay here. God, we simply must dress the character. Stay, stay, I will go myself.
p028_emo_amusement_sentences_1.wav|I like that stand-up comic. I found her pretty funny.
p101_freeform_speech_04_31.wav|I've seen the world
p095_sentences_09_fast_3.wav|She has promised to come on the 20th.
p001_emo_pain_freeform_2.wav|Shit!
p069_freeform_speech_05_31.wav|And being that there weren't many people at the time with car phones,
p091_freeform_speech_04_40.wav|So that that's definitely on my bucket list.
p026_freeform_speech_03_20.wav|when I'm on a plane.
p101_emo_serenity_freeform_1.wav|the fish are biting the birds are chirping this is what serenity is all about outstanding
p099_freeform_speech_05_59.wav|I don't like to stay in one spot.
p059_freeform_speech_03_18.wav|depending on, again, what size the drink was, you would put the espresso shots in it. And, um,
p036_emo_contentment_freeform_0.wav|I am content with sitting here right in front of the television, not doing a gosh darn thing.
p099_sentences_17_regular_0.wav|I had I've always had a value for him he is a deceiver and a villain but those
p087_freeform_speech_04_13.wav|their reactions and the way they interact with each other um i i feel i almost feel bad watching
p101_freeform_speech_05_45.wav|And.
p036_emo_distress_sentences_0.wav|Oh God, I am not sure if we're going to make this flight on time.

p103_emo_desire_sentences_1.wav|Oh, I want that car so badly.
p024_freeform_speech_01_5.wav|And so going out in the woods into a new area, into a place where the ground might not be flat and you have to think carefully about where you put your feet,
p027_freeform_speech_04_76.wav|Like, the, um...
p003_emo_embarassment_sentences_0.wav|I don't know what happened. I followed the recipe perfectly, but the cake just deflated.
p064_freeform_speech_06_55.wav|I don't, I don't even remember what his, his real name is.
p095_sentences_22_regular_1.wav|The snowstorm was still raging.
p006_freeform_speech_04_34.wav|But you kind of have to warm the honey and then put the cinnamon so that way it infuses together.
p069_freeform_speech_05_2.wav|Oh, yeah, no.
p039_freeform_speech_03_4.wav|Modifications were plentiful.

p105_sentences_02_lowpitch_0.wav|It might happen, he added with an involuntary smile.
p012_freeform_speech_04_17.wav|Sometimes what you need to do is depending on how much you're making and everything, you have to
p043_emo_sadness_sentences_3.wav|Life isn't the same without her.

p088_sentences_01_highpitch_0.wav|I will not stay here. God, we simply must dress the character. Stay, stay, I will go myself.
p106_freeform_speech_02_19.wav|Nobody wants a nice, calm, relaxed senior cat to sit on their lap.
p052_emo_pride_freeform_4.wav|Good job.
